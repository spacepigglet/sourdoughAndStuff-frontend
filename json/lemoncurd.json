  "description":"Cakes can get quite sweet and I use sour citrus to cut through that sweetness. I developed this recipe specifically for using as a filling in cakes, and that's why this lemon curd will be a bit more stable than your usual lemon curd. <br> Cakes can also be very filling as heavy whipping cream and butter contains a lot of fat. To help balance the flavours in a cake that will have other fat-heavy components (like mousses or buttercream), I make my lemon curd with a little less fat than your standard lemon curd. Less butter also maintains the acidity of the lemons as more butter will mellow the acidity, which when combined with other cake components creates a balanced cake. That said, if you want a more mellow lemon curd and a more buttery mouth-feel go ahead and add some extra butter.",
